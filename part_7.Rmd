title: Subsetting
---

Another common activity is subsetting data - isolating a portion of the data, usually based on a condition. There are a few different ways we can subset in R, one of which we've already kind of seen with indexing, we just didn't assign the output to a variable.

```{r}
sq_data_age <- sq_data$Age # select one column
sq_data_sounds <- sq_data[,22:24] # select multiple columns
```

<div class = 'exercise'>
Using the above as a model, take a random sample of ten observations (rows) from `sq_data`.
</div>

<div class = 'solution'>
```{r}
sq_data_random_sample <- sq_data[sample(1:3023, 10),] #or
sq_data_random_sample <- sq_data[sample(1:length(sq_data), 10),]
```
</div>

Subsetting on conditions can be achieved with `subset()`.
