## A Glorified calculator

At it's simplest, R is a very fancy calculator

```{r}
1 + 1
2 - 3
6 / 2
3 * 4
```

These basic operators form the basis for more complex calculations that are expressed slightly differently.

```{r}
sqrt(9)
log10(100)
```

R can also string numbers together

```{r}
1:10
```

And groups of numbers can be calculated if the groups are multiples of each other

```{r}
1:10 + 11:20
2 * 1:10
1:2 * 1:10
```

:::exercise

Calculate the result of `3 + 2 * 6`, calculating the addition before multiplication

Take the square root of `20 * 5`

Calculate the log base 2 of 16

Take the square root of the numbers 1 through 10

:::

:::solution

```{r, class.source = 'fold-hide'}
(3 + 2) * 6

sqrt(20 * 5)

log2(16)
```
