If it's not already loaded, read in the data set

```{r, eval = FALSE}
sq_data <- read.csv(file = 'data/2018-cp_squirrel_census.csv',
                    header = TRUE,
                    na.strings = c("", " ", "NA", "NULL", ".", "+")
                    )
```

## Dates & Factors

In addition to logical variables, our data set also has categorical data and date data. Categorical data in R is called factor data. We'll convert a single variable to factor to see how this behaves.

```{r}
sq_data$Age <- as.factor(sq_data$Age)

str(sq_data$Age)

levels(sq_data$Age)
```

This process highlights that we have one additional string character that should be converted to `NA` on import, `?`. Calling `str` tells us that we have a factor with three levels or categories. Calling `levels` lists those categories.

Sometime the levels are not in the order we want them for ordinal categorical data. We can re-assign these.

```{r}
sq_data$Age <- factor(sq_data$Age, levels = c("Juvenile", "Adult", "?"))

levels(sq_data$Age)

str(sq_data$Age)
```

:::exercise

Using the help page for `as.Date`, convert the Date variable, currently structured as `int` to a date class variable.

:::

:::solution

`as.Date` requires a character input, so we must first convert our variable to a character format

```{r, class.source = 'fold-hide', results = FALSE}
sq_data$Date <- as.character(sq_data$Date)
```

Next, we need to specify to `as.Date` how our data is structured - where the year, month, and date are articulated, and whether the year is 4 digits or 2, and the months and days are abbreviated.

```{r, class.source = 'fold-hide', results = FALSE}
sq_data$Date <- as.Date(sq_data$Date, "%m%d%Y")
```

# Importing with a Data Dictionary

The value of having a data dictionary in advance will go a long ways in facilitating this process.

A data dictionary generally describes key attributes about your data - it will list your variables, provide a description of them, and indicate the base type of data it is.

I have a very simple data dictionary for this project. Let's load that in

```{r}
dict_src <- "https://tinyurl.com/4kxt9n8e" # source of the file

download.file(url = dict_src, destfile = 'data/_datadictionary.csv') # download and name the file

data_dict <- read.csv("data/_datadictionary.csv") # read in the file
```

We'll now import our data in a slightly more efficient way

```{r}
na_values <- c("" , " ", ".", "NA", "NULL", "?", "+") # a list of values to use for na.strings

data_types <- data_dict$data.import.class # a list of data types to feed to colClass

sq_data <- read.csv(file = "data/2018-cp_squirrel_census.csv",
         na.strings = na_values,
         colClasses = data_types
           )

str(sq_data)
```

At this point, we've got a pretty clean imported data set. It's likely we'll still find some issues with, but for now let's save it as a cleaned, version 0

```{r}
write.csv(sq_data, "data/2018-cp_squirrel_census_cleaned_v0.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

:::summary

On import, we can control many aspects of our data set, including setting NA values and assigning datat types and classes. This work is facilitated by being organized in advance. Creating a data dictionary will help to facilitate this process.
